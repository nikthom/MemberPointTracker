        To secure club member and officer information, we reccomend backing up the data at least once a week. Lucky for you, 
        the development team provided a quick and easy way to back up the organization's data. At the top of your screen on the 
        navigation bar you will see a button labeled "Backup", just click on the button and three options will drop down to backup
        officer, member, or custom point entry data. After you click on each link, a csv file will be downloaded to your device.
        Each file is labeled with the data it contains and also today's date so you can easily keep a record of when the backup is from.
